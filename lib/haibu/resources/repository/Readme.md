# Repository

## ALL REPOSITORIES SHOULD WORK OFF LOCAL FILES
## DOWNLOADING SOURCE SHOULD BE LEFT TO OUTSIDE SCRIPTS (Haibu's server)

A repository represents an Application's source code.
This may be a dynamic source such as a git repository.
However, it may also be a static source such as a snapshot or tarball.
Repositories may configure environmental variables according to needs, but do not affect the environment they run in.

Repository usage should be limited to installation and retrieval or an application's source code.
